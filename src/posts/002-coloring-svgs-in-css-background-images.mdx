I love using SVG in CSS background images but it sucks that you can't alter the `fill` color easily within your CSS. Here are a few ways around that.

## SVG in CSS backgrounds

Using SVG in CSS backgrounds allows you to use CSS's powerful background sizing and position properties. This makes sizing SVGs much simpler because the image easily scales to the size of your element. Plus you don't have SVG cluttering up your markup.

There are also some nice performance benefits over inline SVG. An SVG in a background image can be cached. Using image sprites and embedding SVG as a data URI can also improve performance.

## Using an SVG background sprite

Creating sprites for SVG uses the same concepts as normal image sprites. The sprite contains all of the versions of an image. By manipulating the `background-size` and `background-position` in your CSS, you choose which version to display. Here's how to set up an SVG sprite:

    <svg
        xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
        width="24"
        height="72">
        <defs>
            <g id="heart">
              <path d="M12 21.35l-1.45-1.32c-5.15-4.67-8.55-7.75-8.55-11.53 0-3.08 2.42-5.5 5.5-5.5 1.74 0 3.41.81 4.5 2.09 1.09-1.28 2.76-2.09 4.5-2.09 3.08 0 5.5 2.42 5.5 5.5 0 3.78-3.4 6.86-8.55 11.54l-1.45 1.31z"/>
            </g>
        </defs>
        <use x="0" y="0" style="fill:red" xlink:href="#heart" />
        <use x="0" y="24" style="fill:orange" xlink:href="#heart" />
        <use x="0" y="48" style="fill:yellow" xlink:href="#heart" />
    </svg>

Use the `xmnls` namespace attribute or the SVG won't work in your background. Also include the `xmlns:xlink` attribute if using links, which I am in the `use` tags. The `width` and `height` need to be large enough to contain all of the images. In the example I'm using three 24x24 icons stacked vertically, so my SVG dimensions are 24x72.

I'm using the `symbol` and `use` tags to keep the file size low. Define the icon shape as a `symbol` and place it in a `defs` block. Give it an `id`. Employ the `use` tag to stamp out versions of this symbol. In the `use` tag, the `x` and `y` coordinates are adjusted so the icons stack on top of each other at 24 unit increments. An inline style with the `fill` property colors the icon. Here's a demo with a bunch of different colored icons defined using this technique.

<div class="codepen-demo">

See the Pen [8a16bad16e744f88133c6a0d709d11ca](http://codepen.io/noahblon/pen/8a16bad16e744f88133c6a0d709d11ca/) by Noah Blon ([@noahblon](http://codepen.io/noahblon)) on [CodePen](http://codepen.io).

I'm using Sass here to make the background positioning easier.

This technique works great everywhere SVG is supported. Because you need to manually create and add new icon versions to the sprite, it’s pretty inflexible.

## Using CSS filters

You can apply Photoshop-like effects to DOM elements with CSS filters. Filters can be chained, with each filter acting on the result of its predecessor.

    <svg
        xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
        width="24"
        height="24"
        viewbox="0 0 24 24">
        <path fill="red" d="M12 21.35l-1.45-1.32c-5.15-4.67-8.55-7.75-8.55-11.53 0-3.08 2.42-5.5 5.5-5.5 1.74 0 3.41.81 4.5 2.09 1.09-1.28 2.76-2.09 4.5-2.09 3.08 0 5.5 2.42 5.5 5.5 0 3.78-3.4 6.86-8.55 11.54l-1.45 1.31z"/>
    </svg>

    .icon-blue {
        -webkit-filter: hue-rotate(220deg) saturate(5);
        filter: hue-rotate(220deg) saturate(5);
    }

In this example, the icon has a pure red `fill` set in the SVG. The `hue-rotate` filter rotates the hue 220 degrees around the rgb color wheel. This makes the icon blue. The algorithm for hue-rotation isn't extremely accurate, so although the output should be pure blue it’s a little off. One way to fix this and boost up the color to full saturation is to add a `saturation` filter. In the example, I added an arbitrarily large value of five to the chain, which increases the saturation by 500%.

By chaining filters together, you can make many colored icons from one colored icon input. With different combinations of `hue-rotate`, `invert`, `brightness`, and `saturation` filters, I've created the ROYGBIV rainbow spectrum and some other basic colors like cyan and magenta.

Creating a grayscale set of filters is super easy. You just add a `grayscale` filter and adjust a `brightness` filter to the amount of gray you need.

This technique isn't super intuitive. It will probably require some trial and error to find the colors you need, especially since the algorithms aren't perfect. In the future, it would be fantastic if CSS filters could also work in HSL space, as they would be much more intuitive.

CSS filters are supported well in most browsers. IE has them listed as "In Development", which means they are in active development and should be added to IE soon. Firefox partially supports filters, with full support coming in future releases.

## CSS masks

With the `mask` property you create a mask that is applied to an element. Everywhere the mask is opaque, or solid, the underlying image shows through. Where it’s transparent, the underlying image is masked out, or hidden. The syntax for a CSS `mask-image` is similar to `background-image`.

    .icon {
        background-color: red;
        mask-image: url(icon.svg);
        -webkit-mask-image: url(icon.svg);
    }

Here I'm setting an SVG as the mask. The `fill` of the icon in the SVG doesn't matter because it masks the background layer which is the color red. Therefore, the result is a red icon. For webkit, I'm using the prefix.

Your background can be a color, image, gradient -- whatever.

<div class="codepen-demo">

See the Pen [SVG Mask](http://codepen.io/noahblon/pen/19e2508e9126afad45740453fd26ede1/) by Noah Blon ([@noahblon](http://codepen.io/noahblon)) on [CodePen](http://codepen.io).

</div>

There are a bunch of properties related to mask, such as `mask-position`, `mask-repeat`, and `mask-size`, which align with CSS `background` properties. You can use the `mask` shorthand like the `background` shorthand:

    .icon {
        background-color: red;
        mask: url(icon.svg) no-repeat 50% 50%;
        -webkit-mask:  url(icon.svg) no-repeat 50% 50%;
    }

Masks are supported in most browsers. The IE team have CSS masks listed as under consideration. Firefox currently doesn't support external SVG masks.

Those are the methods I could think of for coloring an SVG as a background-image with CSS. Are there more? Probably!
